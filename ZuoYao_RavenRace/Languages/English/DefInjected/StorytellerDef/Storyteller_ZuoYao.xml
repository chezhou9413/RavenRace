  <ZuoYao_Storyteller.description>A mysterious Raven woman has contacted you of her own accord.\n\nShe calls herself Zuo Yao and claims to be "quite interested" in your colony.\n\nHer tone always carries a subtle hint of playfulness, as if everything is part of her calculations. Just when you think you've gained a moment's respite, she may be weaving an even greater puzzle in the shadows.\n\n"Don't be nervous, I just want to see how far you can go."\n\nShe drives events at a pace similar to Cassandra, but you can't shake the feeling... she knows something you don't.</ZuoYao_Storyteller.description>
